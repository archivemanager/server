							<h3>Administrative Applications</h3>
							<p>
								ArchiveManager depends on many great open source projects, perhaps the two most important ones are the Neo4j graph database and Elasticsearch for search and navigation.
								In standard installations each application is installed and run as an operating system service.
							</p>
							<h2>Neo4J Graph Database</h2>
							<span style="font-size:12px;color:black;">https://neo4j.com</span>
							<p>
								Neo4j is the world's leading graph database. It is built from the ground up to be a graph database, meaning that its architecture is designed for optimizing fast management, storage, and the traversal of data.
								Neo4j can store trillions of entities for the largest datasets imaginable while being sensitive to compact storage.
							</p>

										<div class="content">
											<p>ArchiveManager includes a web-based administrative application for managing and querying the node databstore.  
											You can access the neo4j application at : <b>http://server-name:7474/browser</b></p>

							<h2>Elasticsearch</h2>
							<p>
								Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. 
								As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.

											<td class="content">
												When running as a windows service, the Kibana service can take a long time to fully start-up, this can cause windows to report that service has failed to start.
												It can also appear as though the service is not started despite being set to start automatically.  
												In most cases the service does ultimately complete successfully and is running in the background, to test this you should try the kibana homepage at <b>http://server-name:5600/app/kibana</b>.
